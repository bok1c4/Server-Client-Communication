This project should cover:

1. Two machines being able to communicate over the same network.
2. Two machines being able to communicate over the two different networks.

Sending messages (like text)
Sending files (any files)

1. Type of Server

   Local Network Communication (Same Network): You’re essentially talking about a socket-based server (not necessarily a "web server") that operates over the TCP/IP protocol. Using sockets in C, you can establish a client-server architecture where one machine acts as the server and listens for incoming connections from clients.
   Cross-Network Communication (Different Networks): To support communication across networks, you’ll need to consider:
   Port Forwarding: Allow the server to be accessible via the router’s public IP.
   Dynamic DNS: Handle changes in public IP addresses.
   NAT Traversal: For direct peer-to-peer connections (using techniques like STUN, TURN, or UPnP).
   Encryption: Secure communication, such as using TLS for secure data exchange.

2. Why Not a Web Server?

A web server typically serves HTML content over HTTP/HTTPS. While you could use a web server framework for your project (e.g., an embedded HTTP server), this isn't strictly necessary. You can use raw TCP or UDP sockets for file and message transfers. 3. Features to Include

    File Transfer:
        Implement protocols like FTP or create a custom file transfer mechanism.
        Consider chunking large files for efficient transfer.
    Message Exchange:
        Use plain text for initial testing and later upgrade to a protocol like JSON or protobuf for structured messages.
    Security:
        Encrypt the communication using libraries like OpenSSL for TLS.
        Consider relays if direct communication isn’t possible.

4. Design and Implementation in C

   Sockets Programming: Use the socket(), bind(), listen(), and accept() functions for server implementation. Use connect() for the client.
   Multithreading:
   Server should handle multiple clients. Use threads (pthread in C) or asynchronous I/O (e.g., select() or epoll).
   Protocols:
   Start with a simple application-layer protocol (e.g., a header to indicate file/message type, size, etc.).
   Error Handling:
   Robust error detection and recovery mechanisms.
   File Transfer:
   Use file streams (fopen, fread, fwrite) to send/receive files over sockets.

5. Communication Beyond the Same Network

Once you have a local server working:

    Public IP Access:
        Deploy your server on a public-facing machine (like a cloud VPS) or set up port forwarding on your router.
    Relay Server:
        A central server can relay data between devices that cannot directly connect.
    Direct Peer-to-Peer (P2P):
        Use libraries or techniques for NAT traversal (e.g., libp2p or ICE frameworks).

6. Suggested Steps

   Start Small:
   Implement basic communication between two devices on the same network.
   Example: Send and receive text messages between your MacBook and Arch Linux machine.
   Add File Transfer:
   Extend the application to support file uploads and downloads.
   Enhance Security:
   Encrypt the data stream using TLS or a custom encryption layer.
   Enable Cross-Network Communication:
   Deploy a public server or use NAT traversal for P2P.
   Build User-Friendly Tools:
   Add a CLI or basic UI for users to initiate file transfers or messages.

7. Learning and Challenges

   Networking: Learn socket programming in C thoroughly.
   Security: Encrypt all data transfers to ensure privacy.
   Scalability: Design the server to handle multiple clients efficiently.
   Cross-Network Handling: Learn about NAT, dynamic DNS, and port forwarding.
